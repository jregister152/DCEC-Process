          <p class="info">Laura Capell Director of Marketing and Developement at Developmental Center for Exceptional Children</p>
          </header>
					<p>From my interview with Laura I was able to learn more about the DCEC's organization and function as a program as well as what she determined their websites goals and audiences to be from their marketing's point of view.</p>
          <h5>The DCEC program</h5>
          <p>Mission Statement: “To serve children living with disabilities and special needs in a setting designed to meet their individual needs.”</p>
          <p>The DCEC is a 501-c non-profit organization previously fully government funded but now relies manly on support and donations from the community and sponsers. They are a unique day center which provides a combination of early education and onsite therapy for children with special needs. The DCEC cares for children from six weeks to ten years of age with any diagnosed learning disabilty ranging form ADHD to Autism. While not offically accredited by the South Carolina school system, the DCEC is DSS and ABC liscensed and is working towards becoming a charter school.</p>
          <h5>Admissions</h5>
          <p>Students are typically referred to the DCEC by their pediatrition or Early Interventionists and are admitted only with a diagnosis bar extremely rare circumstances. As 70% of their students' families are low income or at risk, the DCEC has a no child turned away policy and tuition is based on a sliding scale determined by diagnosis and income. They also accept ABC copay vouchers.</p>
          <h5>Audiences</h5>
          <p>These are the audience groups defined and prioratized by the DCEC for their website.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Parents of potential students</li>
            <li>Donors and sponsers</li>
            <li>Volunteers (individual and organizations)</li>
            <li>Coorporate partners</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Goals</h5>
          <p>Laura emphasized that as a non-profit education center the main functions of their website are recruitment and fund raising. She says it all really boils down to the community's lack of awareness of the DCEC and finding ways to promote their mission. For the most part the DCEC is on a need to know basis, and those who don't have a need for their services don't know about their existance. Their website should be a landingpage for their other touchpoints and direct the user to either contact, visit, donate or volunteer.</p>
          <h5>Functions</h5>
          <p>These are the determined functions that the DCEC website would need to fulfill.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Donation platform</li>
            <li>Volunteer info and inquiry</li>

            <li>Showcase the DCEC</li>
            <li>Related events</li>
            <li>Promote awareness to the community</li>
            <li>List staff and board of directers</li>
            <li>Retell the history of the DCEC</li>
            <li>Advertise non-monetary needs</li>
            <li>Legitamize program for sponsers and partners</li>
            <li>List location</li>
            <li>Provide methods of contact</li>

            <h5>Current Website</h5>
            <table class="alt">
              <thead>
                <tr>

                    </ul>
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <h5>Portrayal of DCEC students</h5>
        <p>To portray all students as champions, super heroes with a smile. To reveal not their disabilities but different abilities. To showcase the students as they are, loving life with a smile on their face. The heart of a happy place.</p>

        </header>
        <p>I had Stefan approach the current DCEC website as a first time potential donor.</p>
        <h5>First Impressions</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Donation call to action on home page</li>
            <li>No immediate direction to tell me whats going on</li>
            <li>Get rid of the background</li>
            <li>Not encouraged to read copy, needs to be broken up more</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Other critiques</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Logo blends into background sun</li>
            <li>More obvious tag line</li>
            <li>Show care for sponsers with higher quality logos</li>
            <li>Testimonials feel heartfelt and relatable and need to be featured more.</li>
            <li>Mission statement needs to be more prominent be stay at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>Contact info needs to be on every page</li>
            <li>More image based (founders, staff, students)</li>
            <li>Incorporate a history timeline to break up about us</li>
            <li>More in depth and higher quality staff bios</li>
            <li>Resources need smaller real estate as they are portals to another site and don't lead to donations</li>
            <li>Feature more events and an event calendar</li>
            <li>Update contact page</li>
            <li>Get rid of the blog</li>
            <li>Donation form needs to cater to both those who donate to be recognized and those who want to remain anonomous</li>
            <li>Have list of donors on a seperate page</li>
            <li>Donation more like a walkthrough like app onboarding, walk through story and break down the process</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Key Takeaway</h5>
        <p>Stefan determined that the website needs to function as an emotional connection between the viewer and the organization. Using more imagery and friendlier even childish copy along with items like testimonies will make the site more relatable and personal to the user. This is what will drive the viewer into donating or volunteering.</p>
