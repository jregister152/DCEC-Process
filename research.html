The organization serves the low income and at risk community of Pickens, Oconee and Anderson counties.</p>
				<br></br>
				<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
				<p>To serve children with different abilities/special needs in a setting designed to meet their individual needs.</p>
				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>The DCEC serves students from birth to age 5 with disabilities including Autism, Down Syndrome, Cystic Fibrosis, Cerebral Palsy, seizure disorders, neuromuscular conditions, traumatic brain injuries, developmental delays, genetic disorders, medical conditions, dietary restrictions, severe allergies, and physical impairments. The program is designed so that the students can successfully transition into elementary school after completing the program.</p>
				<h4>Donations</h4>
				<p>As a non-profit organization the DCEC relies heavily on donations and support from the community. They are in need of both monetary and non-monetary contributions.</p>
				<h4>Resources</h4>
				<p>The DCEC website provides information and links to other related therapies and resources for parents of special needs children.</p>
				<h4>Related Media</h4>
				<p>I found related events such as The Champions Run and Moms and Mimosas as well as a pdf brochure and links to the DCEC Facebook page.</p>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>In sumamry I found the DCEC website to be cluttered and unorganized. It was not user friendly and there was no direction for the user. The long blocks of copy were indigestible and imagery was not often utilized. The donation platform is functional but not appealing to the user. Overall I found it to be distracting and not an efficient means to communicate the DCEC's mission nor meet their functions as a non-profit organization.</p>

As a non-profit, Charity: Water shares similar audiences and goals as the DCEC and provides a visual reference for design layout for my redesign.</p>

						<h2>Interviews</h2>
					</header>
          <h3>Client</h3>
          <header>
          <p class="info">Laura Capell - Director of Marketing and Developement at the Developmental Center for Exceptional Children</p>
          </header>
					<p>From my interview with Laura I was able to learn more about the DCEC's organization and function as a program as well as what she determined their websites goals and audiences to be from their marketing's point of view.</p>
          <p><h4>Mission Statement:</h4> “To serve children living with disabilities and special needs in a setting designed to meet their individual needs.”</p>
          <p>The DCEC is a 501-c non-profit organization previously fully government funded but now relying mainly on support and donations from the community and sponsers. They are a unique day center which provides a combination of early education and onsite therapy for children with special needs. The DCEC cares for children from six weeks to ten years of age with any diagnosed learning disabilty ranging form ADHD to Autism. While not offically accredited by the South Carolina school system, the DCEC is DSS and ABC liscensed and is working towards becoming a charter school.</p>
          <h4>Admissions</h4>
          <p>Students are typically referred to the DCEC by their pediatrician or early interventionists and are admitted only with a diagnosis bar extremely rare circumstances. As 70% of their students' families are low income or at risk, the DCEC has a no child turned away policy and tuition is based on a sliding scale determined by diagnosis and income. They also accept ABC copay vouchers.</p>
          <h4>Audiences</h4>
          <p>These are the audience groups defined and prioratized by the DCEC for their website.</p>
          <ol>
						<li>Donors and sponsers</li>
            <li>Parents of potential students</li>
            <li>Volunteers (individual and organizations)</li>
            <li>Coorporate partners</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <p>Laura emphasized that as a non-profit education center the main functions of their website are fundraising and recruitment. She says it all really boils down to the community's lack of awareness of the DCEC and finding ways to promote their mission. For the most part the DCEC is on a need to know basis, and those who don't have a need for their services don't know about their existance. Their website should be a landingpage for their other touchpoints and direct the user to either contact, visit, donate or volunteer.</p>
          <h4>Functions</h4>
          <p>These are the determined functions that the DCEC website would need to fulfill.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Donation platform</li>
            <li>Volunteer info and inquiry</li>

        <h4>Portrayal of DCEC students</h4>
        <p>To portray all students as champions, superheroes with a smile. To reveal not their disabilities but different abilities. To showcase the students as they are, loving life with a smile on their face. The heart of a happy place.</p>
        <h3>User</h3>
        <header>
        <p class="info">Stefan Cupka - Graphic Designer and Anderson University Alumni</p>
        </header>
        <p>I had Stefan approach the current DCEC website as a first time potential donor.</p>
        <h4>First Impressions</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Donation call to action on home page</li>
            <li>No immediate direction to tell me what is going on</li>
            <li>Get rid of the background</li>
            <li>Not encouraged to read copy, needs to be broken up more</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Other Critiques</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Logo blends into background sun</li>
            <li>More obvious tag line</li>
            <li>Show care for sponsers with higher quality logos</li>
            <li>Testimonials feel heartfelt and relatable and need to be featured more.</li>
            <li>Mission statement needs to be more prominent and stay at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>Contact info needs to be on every page</li>
            <li>More image based (founders, staff, students)</li>
            <li>Incorporate a history timeline to break up about us</li>
            <li>More in depth and higher quality staff bios</li>
            <li>Resources need smaller real estate as they are portals to another site and don't lead to donations</li>
            <li>Feature more events and an event calendar</li>
            <li>Update contact page</li>
            <li>Get rid of the blog</li>
            <li>Donation form needs to cater to both those who donate to be recognized and those who want to remain anonomous</li>
            <li>Have list of donors on a seperate page</li>
            <li>Donation more like a walkthrough like app onboarding, walk through story and break down the process</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
        <p>Stefan determined that the website needs to function as an emotional connection between the viewer and the organization. Using more imagery and friendlier even childish copy along with items like testimonies will make the site more relatable and personal to the user. This is what will drive the viewer into donating or volunteering.</p>
