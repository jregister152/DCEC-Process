          <p class="info">Laura Capell Director of Marketing and Developement at Developmental Center for Exceptional Children</p>
          </header>
					<p>From my interview with Laura I was able to learn more about the DCEC's organization and function as a program as well as what she determined their websites goals and audiences to be from their marketing's point of view.</p>
          <h5>The DCEC program</h5>
          <p>Mission Statement: “To serve children living with disabilities and special needs in a setting designed to meet their individual needs.”</p>
          <p>The DCEC is a 501-c non-profit organization previously fully government funded but now relies manly on support and donations from the community and sponsers. They are a unique day center which provides a combination of early education and onsite therapy for children with special needs. The DCEC cares for children from six weeks to ten years of age with any diagnosed learning disabilty ranging form ADHD to Autism. While not offically accredited by the South Carolina school system, the DCEC is DSS and ABC liscensed and is working towards becoming a charter school.</p>
          <h5>Admissions</h5>
          <p>Students are typically referred to the DCEC by their pediatrition or Early Interventionists and are admitted only with a diagnosis bar extremely rare circumstances. As 70% of their students' families are low income or at risk, the DCEC has a no child turned away policy and tuition is based on a sliding scale determined by diagnosis and income. They also accept ABC copay vouchers.</p>
          <h5>Audiences</h5>
          <p>These are the audience groups defined and prioratized by the DCEC for their website.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Parents of potential students</li>
            <li>Donors and sponsers</li>
            <li>Volunteers (individual and organizations)</li>
            <li>Coorporate partners</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Goals</h5>
          <p>Laura emphasized that as a non-profit education center the main functions of their website are recruitment and fund raising. She says it all really boils down to the community's lack of awareness of the DCEC and finding ways to promote their mission. For the most part the DCEC is on a need to know basis, and those who don't have a need for their services don't know about their existance. Their website should be a landingpage for their other touchpoints and direct the user to either contact, visit, donate or volunteer.</p>
          <h5>Functions</h5>
          <p>These are the determined functions that the DCEC website would need to fulfill.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Donation platform</li>

        <h5>Portrayal of DCEC students</h5>
        <p>To portray all students as champions, super heroes with a smile. To reveal not their disabilities but different abilities. To showcase the students as they are, loving life with a smile on their face. The heart of a happy place.</p>
